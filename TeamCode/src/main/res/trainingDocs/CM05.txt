CM-05

DESCRIPTION:
I can close my project and re-open it from the hard drive.

CRITERIA:
Occasionally, when checking out a project from GitHub for the first time, Android Studio cannot
successfully build the project. When this happens, all of the robot code files have a significant
number of errors. The student should know how to Close their project, close Android Studio, and
re-open the project from the file system (and not from Version Control).
