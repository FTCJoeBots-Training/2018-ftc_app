PB-02

DESCRIPTION:
I can write a program to drive two motors via the Gamepad to simulate a tank drive

CRITERIA:
The student can write a program to simulate a tank drive use a left and right motor.


PSUEDOCODE:

// Define variables for the left and right motors and for the left and right motor power

// Map the motor variables to the hardware motors

// Start a loop to control program flow (while opModeIsActive() )

// Set the left power variable equal to the inverse (negative) of the gamepad1.left_stick_y input.

// Set the right power variable equal to the gamepad1.right_stick_y input. (Student should be able
// to explain why this variable is not inverted).

// Call the motor.setPower method for each motor to set the motor power to the power variables.

// close the loop

// set motor power to zero for each motor
